 Local Storage 
 Session Storage

we will use redux persist library for local storage.


Session storage persist it throughout the session. As long as the tab is open even if we refresh the page we will still have access to 
what we have stored in session storage. If we close the page we will lose whatever is stored in session storage.

Local storage will persist until we clear it out. We will have it even if we close the windows close the tab.

Local Storage has getitem and setitem. set allows to put in into the local storage and get grabs it from the storage.

window.localStorage.setItem('myitemkey', JSON.stringify(myObjecttoStore))

It only stores string so we must convert to string.
